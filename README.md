## M-Afrik Carhub

Built M-Afrik Carhub, a car listing website with Next.js 14 for enhanced performance and learning. It showcases diverse car types with detailed information, user-friendly design, and advanced filtering & pagination.

Open [M-Afrik Carhub](https://car-explorer-portal.vercel.app/) to access the production website.
